# OCaml Xen Tools - Work in Progress

This is the OCaml code that is part of the [Xen] hypervisor but ported
to the [jbuilder] build system -- see also its [manual]). The goal is to
package this code as a collection of [Opam] packages to make it more
accessible for OCaml developers. This is work in progress.

## Building

This code currently builds on a Debian system with these packages
installed:

* libxen-dev
* libsystemd-dev
* opam
* m4

The above list is most likely incomplete. I'm hoping to provide a Docker
container with all dependencies.

To actually build the code, run:

```
$ opam init
$ eval `opam config env`
$ opam install jbuilder
$ jbuilder build
```

If you are an OCaml developer, you most likely have [Opam] already
installed and configured.

## Changes

Some small changes were required:

* The original code used `*.inc` files for C header files and this 
  suffix is not recognised by [jbuilder] so it was changed to `*.h`.

* For oxenstored, stub C code has been moved into a library and
  directory of its own. Again, this was required to meet [jbuilder]
  restrictions.


## Todo

* Write Opam files
* Hook up code generation - a small part of the code is autogenerated
